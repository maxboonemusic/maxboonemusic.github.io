<p>
I am a passionate and adaptable musician specialising in composition, and
liturgical organ playing. I graduated from the 
<a href="https://www.rncm.ac.uk/" target="_blank">Royal Northern College of Music</a>, 
studying composition with Adam Gorb and Gary Carpenter. 
</p>

<p>
As a composer I have worked with a broad range of performers and written in
diverse styles. I have experience in writing liturgical music, composing two
pieces for the Easter liturgy which were performed in the Church of the Holy
Name, Manchester. I also write more experimental works, and have had such
pieces performed by the RIOT Ensemble in Hallé St Peters, several orchestral
works, extended electro-acoustic compositions and I have had music workshopped
by the BBC singers in 2024. 
</p>

<p>
As well as composition I am also a confident arranger in various styles, having
worked with the RNCM big band and session orchestra several times, as well as
producing several arrangements for Tim Burgess of the Charlatans, which went on
to be performed several times at various concerts and festivals. 
</p>

<p>
I work as a freelance organist, and have played for Services across
Hertfordshire and London. I am also the regular organist for the 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LuminaChoirKingsLangley/" target="_blank">Lumina Choir</a>,
having performed Schubert's Mass in G, and Fauré's Requiem among many other
works. I am the recipient of the Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire Organist's
Association Bursary.
